user: Please use the 2020 NPP-VIIRS nighttime light imagery and LandScan population data to measure the population with access to electricity in Shanghai, in accordance with the methodology for SDG Indicator 7.1.1 (Proportion of population with access to electricity).
assistant: The knowledge base query encountered a recursion error. I will instead summarize the standard methodology for measuring population with access to electricity using nighttime light (NTL) imagery and population data according to SDG Indicator 7.1.1 from domain knowledge:

1. Obtain annual nighttime light imagery (e.g., NPP-VIIRS) for the target year and region.
2. Obtain population raster data (e.g., LandScan) for the same year and region.
3. Preprocess NTL data: remove noise, apply thresholding to identify lit areas representing electrified zones.
4. Overlay the binary electrified mask on the population raster.
5. Sum the population counts within electrified areas to estimate population with access to electricity.
6. Calculate the proportion by dividing the electrified population by the total population in the region.
7. Use administrative boundaries (e.g., Shanghai city boundary) to clip data and ensure spatial consistency.

I will now design a step-by-step analysis plan and then proceed to acquire the required data.
Analysis Plan for Measuring Population with Access to Electricity in Shanghai (2020) Using NPP-VIIRS and LandScan Data:

Step 1: Acquire Data
- Download 2020 annual NPP-VIIRS nighttime light imagery for Shanghai city.
- Download 2020 LandScan population raster for Shanghai city.
- Obtain Shanghai administrative boundary shapefile for spatial clipping.

Step 2: Preprocess Nighttime Light Data
- Clip NTL raster to Shanghai boundary.
- Apply thresholding on NTL brightness to create a binary electrification mask (lit vs unlit areas).
  (Threshold can be determined by literature or Otsu method.)

Step 3: Preprocess Population Data
- Clip population raster to Shanghai boundary.

Step 4: Calculate Population with Access to Electricity
- Mask population raster with electrification mask.
- Sum population values in electrified areas.

Step 5: Calculate Total Population
- Sum population values in entire Shanghai boundary.

Step 6: Calculate Proportion
- Compute proportion = (population with access) / (total population).

Step 7: Output Results
- Report population with access, total population, and proportion.
- Optionally export maps and statistics.

Next, I will assign the Data_Searcher agent to download the required datasets for Shanghai 2020.
