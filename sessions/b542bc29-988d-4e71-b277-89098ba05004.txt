user: Please use the 2020 NPP-VIIRS nighttime light imagery and LandScan population data to measure the population with access to electricity in Shanghai, in accordance with the methodology for SDG Indicator 7.1.1 (Proportion of population with access to electricity).
assistant: The attempt to download the 2020 NPP-VIIRS nighttime light imagery for Shanghai from Google Earth Engine failed due to permission issues with the GEE project.

To proceed, I suggest we try an alternative approach:
- Check if the NPP-VIIRS 2020 annual data for Shanghai is already available in our local data repository or previously downloaded.
- If not available locally, we can request the Data_Searcher agent to search for publicly available NPP-VIIRS 2020 annual data for Shanghai from other sources or open repositories.

Shall I proceed to check for existing local data or assign the Data_Searcher to search for the required NPP-VIIRS data?
