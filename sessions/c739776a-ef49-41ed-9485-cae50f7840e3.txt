user: Please measure the population with access to electricity in Shanghai, in accordance with the methodology for SDG Indicator 7.1.1 (Proportion of population with access to electricity), using the 2020 NPP-VIIRS NTL imagery and LandScan population data.
assistant: Shanghai is a municipality and may not be listed under the "province" scale level in the dataset. For annual NPP-VIIRS-Like data, only "country" and "province" scales are supported, and Shanghai might be considered a "city" scale which is not supported for annual data.

To proceed, I suggest two options:
1. Download the annual NPP-VIIRS-Like data for the whole country (China) and then clip to Shanghai using administrative boundaries.
2. Download monthly or daily NTL data for Shanghai at the city scale and aggregate to annual.

Please confirm which approach you prefer or if you want me to try another dataset or scale.
