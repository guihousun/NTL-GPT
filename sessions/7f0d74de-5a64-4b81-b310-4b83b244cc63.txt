user: Please use the 2020 NPP-VIIRS NTL imagery and LandScan population data to measure the population with access to electricity, in accordance with the methodology for SDG Indicator 7.1.1 (Proportion of population with access to electricity).
assistant: The methodology for measuring SDG Indicator 7.1.1 (Proportion of population with access to electricity) using nighttime light (NTL) imagery and population data involves the following key steps:

1. Download the 2020 NPP-VIIRS nighttime light imagery for the target region.
2. Download the 2020 LandScan gridded population data for the same region.
3. Process the NTL and population rasters to classify electrified areas by applying a threshold on NTL brightness (e.g., NTL > 0).
4. Calculate the population with access to electricity by summing the population in electrified areas.
5. Optionally, obtain administrative boundaries to aggregate and summarize the population with access by region.

Next, please specify the target region (e.g., country, province, city) for which you want to perform this analysis, so I can proceed with data acquisition and processing.
user: Shanghai, and set the threshold for NTL brightness is NTL>5
assistant: I have successfully obtained the administrative boundary shapefile for Shanghai and downloaded the 2020 LandScan population data for Shanghai city.

Since the annual NPP-VIIRS-Like data download for Shanghai city or province scale failed, I suggest we try to download monthly or daily NTL data for Shanghai city in 2020 and then composite it to annual scale locally.

Please confirm if you want me to proceed with downloading monthly or daily NTL data for Shanghai city in 2020 for compositing, or if you have other preferences.
