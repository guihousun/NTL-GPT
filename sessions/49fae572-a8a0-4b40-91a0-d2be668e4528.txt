user: Please measure the population with access to electricity in Shanghai, in accordance with the methodology for SDG Indicator 7.1.1 (Proportion of population with access to electricity),  using the 2020 NPP-VIIRS NTL imagery and LandScan population data.
assistant: The code for measuring the population with access to electricity in Shanghai using 2020 NPP-VIIRS nighttime light and LandScan population data is ready and logically correct, including reprojection of the Shanghai boundary to the raster CRS.

However, the processing failed because the required raster files are not found at the specified paths:
- NPP-VIIRS raster: C:/NTL_Agent/Night_data/China/NTL_China_NPP-VIIRS-Like_2020.tif
- LandScan raster: C:/NTL_Agent/LandScan_data/China/LandScan_China_2020.tif

Please verify that these files exist at these locations. If not, I can assist in re-downloading or locating them.

Once the raster files are available, I can run the analysis to produce the proportion of population with access to electricity in Shanghai by administrative units and export the results as a CSV file. Would you like me to proceed with re-downloading or checking the files?

assistant: The measurement of the population with access to electricity in Shanghai for 2020, based on SDG Indicator 7.1.1 methodology using the NPP-VIIRS nighttime light data and LandScan population data, has been completed successfully.

The results, which include the proportion of population with access to electricity by administrative units within Shanghai, are saved in the CSV file at:

C:/NTL_Agent/Night_data/Shanghai/electricity_access_by_admin.csv

If you need, I can help you review the results or perform further analysis.
