user: Please use the 2020 NPP-VIIRS nighttime light imagery and LandScan population data to measure the population with access to electricity in Shanghai, in accordance with the methodology for SDG Indicator 7.1.1 (Proportion of population with access to electricity).
assistant: I encountered an error when querying the knowledge base for the methodology of SDG Indicator 7.1.1 using nighttime light and population data. I will instead summarize the standard approach based on domain knowledge:

- SDG Indicator 7.1.1 measures the proportion of the population with access to electricity.
- Nighttime light (NTL) imagery is used as a proxy for electrification because lit areas indicate electricity use.
- Population data (e.g., LandScan) provides spatial distribution of people.
- The common method is to overlay a thresholded NTL image (lit vs unlit) with population raster.
- Population in lit areas is summed and divided by total population to estimate the proportion with access.
- The NPP-VIIRS 2020 annual composite is a suitable NTL dataset.
- LandScan 2020 population raster provides population counts.
- The analysis requires spatial alignment and consistent projection.
- Thresholding NTL brightness to define lit areas is critical; literature often uses a threshold around 1-5 nW/cm2/sr for VIIRS-like data.
- The output is a single value: population with electricity access / total population in Shanghai.

Next, I will design a step-by-step analysis plan and then acquire the required data.
The analysis plan for measuring SDG Indicator 7.1.1 (Proportion of population with access to electricity) in Shanghai using 2020 NPP-VIIRS nighttime light imagery and LandScan population data is as follows:

1. Data Acquisition:
   - Download 2020 annual NPP-VIIRS nighttime light imagery for Shanghai at city scale.
   - Download 2020 LandScan population raster for Shanghai at city scale.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Ensure both datasets are in the same coordinate reference system (CRS).
   - Clip or mask both datasets to the administrative boundary of Shanghai.

3. Nighttime Light Thresholding:
   - Apply a threshold to the NTL raster to create a binary mask of lit (electrified) vs unlit areas.
   - Literature suggests a threshold around 1-5 nW/cm2/sr for VIIRS-like data; we can start with 1 nW/cm2/sr.

4. Population Aggregation:
   - Multiply the binary lit mask by the population raster to get population counts in electrified areas.
   - Sum the population in lit areas and total population in Shanghai.

5. Indicator Calculation:
   - Calculate the proportion: (Population in lit areas) / (Total population).

6. Output:
   - Report the proportion as the estimate of population with access to electricity in Shanghai in 2020.

Next, I will start by acquiring the required data: 2020 NPP-VIIRS nighttime light imagery and 2020 LandScan population data for Shanghai.
